readme.txt

entry points to code are prefixed 'sim'. 

sim_check_force_velocity:
- take a look at the hill-type model (DOHILL) vs linearize f-v relationship (DOLINEAR)

sim_dolinear12.m
- run simulations with different kinds of muscles. do perturbation tests for sensitivity at different joints. 

the muscle code is explained perhaps better in ode_jumper.m. Also is present in sim_check_force_velocity.m!
